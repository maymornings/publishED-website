Welcome to the Launch–

We may not be able to convene in a bar for live readings this semester, but we have carved out a small corner of the internet where these pieces can live until ‘IGNITE’ makes its way into print. Once it does, copies will hopefully be found at all our events next semester, as well as in local establishments like Lighthouse. You’re more than welcome to get in touch with us next semester if you’d like to get your hands on one.  

For this mini-launch, we reached out to this semester’s contributors, some of whom were able to record their performances. You’ll find these below and the entire magazine “here”.

Until then, grab a drink, or a cup of tea, and settle in for some beautiful words.
